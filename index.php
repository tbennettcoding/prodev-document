			<h3>Capstone</h3>
			<h4>Forbidden Island</h4>
			<p>As part of learning more about the other members making up the Q-review (Jeopardy) Capstone team, we played a game of Forbidden Island. The purpose of the game is to work together in order to defeat the board. As time goes on the game becomes increasingly more difficult as the ways to loose stack against you. Much like when working on a project, this game allowed us all to learn characteristics about each other that otherwise may have been left unknown.</p>
			<p>I think our team is comprised of some very strong willed people and at times this may cause conflict. Along with that, there are two types of personalities present in our group. The first is the energetic "leader", who makes their voice heard in each conversation and is not afraid to question or argue. The second is a more "passive" style where ideas come and go, considering all options from a more distant point of view. While there may be a clash of ideas, because we are all able to communicate, I believe that our group will be able to overcome challenges by talking and working through them together.</p>

			<p>I was surprised to find myself on an Alumni page for the University of New Mexico's Robert O. Anderson School of Management. Outside of that, everything I found was in regards to athletic achievements. It seems that there is not much surface level public information on Tristan Bennett from Albuquerque, NM.</p>

			<h3>Direct and Indirect Initiatives</h3>

			<p>This passt week I approached my old employer to discuss updating their website post graduation. They are interested, however unsure about what it is that they need. Coincidentally I don't know what they are using and will need to figure out what is wrong on the back end.
			I also talked to family friends in order to get my name out there regarding what I'm learning. It allowed them to think of their own friends thaey may put me in touch with to design a site for them.</p>

			<h3>Introspection</h3>
			<p>When it comes to goals, I've been lost. I have been wondering around, going through the motions trying to find what it is that I want to do and who I want to be. Internally, I feel lost with no sense of direction and I feel that this has put me in a state of hopelessness. There are times when I feel that "maybe I'm not meant to do anything important. Maybe this job is all that I am able to do." While internally I feel stuck, externally there are people and places that present opportunities to me, I just need to recognize and take them.</p>
			<p>Because I feel lost and stuck in my own life I have, in part, adopted a mentality to help others when they need it. Sometimes it is simple encouragement, other times it's going out with them to find someting they wan to pursue, or push them to do it. Creating value or allowing others to see the value in themselves is something that I have always enjoyed doing because in those moments there is genuine emotion. </p>
			<p>While I feel that, at times, I help others, most of the time it seems I lack drive. Many people have told me that I have potential in certain skills or areas, however I can never seem to bring myself to do anything about it. While I don't disagree that I professional potential, I don't know how to act on it. This is where I feel that I have nothing. My actions contradict what I believe in cases like this, and when I realize that I missed that chance, all I can do is revert back to the belief that "maybe it's not for me." This is one of the aspects I like least about myself. Knowing I have the ability to do anything, and letting it all slip by.</p>

			<h3>How I use my Whole Brain</h3>

			<p>Short Answer: <em>I think</em></p>

			<p>My brain works in a circular motion, passing things back and forth from one side of the brain to the other.
				Generally, my left brain dislikes something logical, which sets off an emotion or something that is based
				in feeling on the right side and then returns it to the left. It becomes a war between hemispheres that can
				make for some fun arguments.</p>

		<h3>Golden Circle</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Allow for the best use of time.</li>
			<li>Providing a service that brings more desirable data to users faster.</li>
			<li>Create code that will allow competitive gamers to see stats and rankings quickly following the completion
				of a match, allowing for more time spent improving.</li>
		</ol>

			<hr>

		<h2 class = "centerText">Elevator Pitch</h2>

		<p><strong>Version 1</strong></p>

		<p>I am working on software that will allow competitive gamers to access accurate league standings and ladder rankings
			more efficiently. This will allow individuals more time in game and less time calculating potential stats.</p>

		<p>Unlike similar software, I will involve the community in development in order to accurately present desired information as fast as possible.
			Although it will take longer to develop, on average less time will be spent waiting on scores and more time improving in game.</p>

		<p>How long do you currently wait for stats to update after completing a game?</p>

			<p><strong>Version 2</strong></p>
			<p>Hi my name is Tristan Bennett. I'm a Full Stack Developer interested in designing software that allows users to more efficiently manage their time. I am currently working with a group
				of developers to present more relatable data, faster. How much time do you spend waiting on information?</p>

			<h2 class = "centerText">Weekly Reflections</h2>
			<h3>Week 1</h3>
			<p>Week one was a incredible! Having the opportunity to learn so much information, while difficult, has proven to be an exciting new step. Learning to develop alongside the other members of Cohort 19 and hearing the success stories from those who came before us is inspiring. I look forward to what week two and the rest of the Bootcamp has to offer!</p>
			<h3>Week 2</h3>
			<p>Week two went by very quickly. I was a little uneasy at the beginning of the week considering the assignment over the weekend, regarding data design, I was unable to complete. As it turned out the class was not aware of, or given, information that allowed us to complete our database set up using UUIDs. Even with that blow to my confidence, I am having a fantastic time! I really enjoy the style of the Bootcamp and am extremely happy about taking advantage of the opportunity. As we move into working heavily on our personal websites and capstones, I am anxious about my time management. Hopefully my decision to join some of the other students at Simms Place as a location to study. While it's difficult to not spend time with those close to me, I am blessed to have a support group that understands my situation and is encouraging throughout it all. I am looking forward to completing data design and starting our capstone projects, with all the challenges they will bring. </p>
			<h3>Week 3</h3>
			<p>Week three flew by! It was very nice to have days to simply work on projects, however I hope that those "free" days have not put me behind in any way. Starting CSS proved more difficult for me that I expected. While I think I was able grasp the concepts, in practice I am struggling to make the CSS do what I want. I believe that I need to possibly spend more time on the CSS and front end than on any other aspect of what have learned so far. Going into week four and the beginning of capstone projects is an exciting prospect. I am looking forward to working with a group to create something from scratch.</p>
			<h3>Week 4</h3>
				<p>Week four was much more stressful than all the previous weeks. On top of getting our Capstone groups and beginning to work on them, I had a personal issue arise that caused some considerable stress. While I have worked through most of that now, I cannot help but feel that I lost some valuable time in regards to coding and learning. Moving forward I need to put more effort into staying focused for long periods of time. By doing this, I will be able to accomplish more in one sitting and will most likely feel less stress. My hope is that I will be able to make time for my personal website while in the midst of the capstone. Regardless of the how hard the work ahead will be, I am excited to see what our power group will be able to accomplish. Q-review coming soon!</p>
			<h3>Graduation Reflection</h3>
			<p>The knowledge I gained in the bootcamp was invaluable. Spending as much time as we have on a project and seeing it through to the end, generating a working product that may be used by other Cohorts to come was very rewarding. While I am not completely confident in my own skills, I know that with some more practice, I will be able to accomplish many more interesting things.</p>
			<h3>Final Self Evaluation</h3>
			<p>I feel less like an imposter in web development now that I have nearly completed a project that was built from the ground up with a team of incredible people. I would like to think that I know what I am doing, however, I believe that I have really only scratched the surface and need to keep learning.</p>
			<p>I am looking forward to finding a career in the tech industry and seeing what I can accomplish with a team of driven individuals. As clich&eacute; as it may sound, I think I have "learned how to learn." Most of the knowledge I have, was only really acquired from trial and error while reading up on the things I was using. While this method may not always work or be acceptable, it has allowed me to move, in my own eyes, fairly quickly in the implementation of new material.</p>
			<p>I would be lying if I thought I was ready for a full career in tech, however I feel that starting as an intern with a good company or a good group of people will help me prepare myself for the future I hope to create.</p>
