			<li>Focused</li>

		<br>

		<h3>Golden Circle</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>I believe there is always more to learn and ways to better oneself.</li>
			<li>Improving requires discomfort, therefore I try new things and push myself.</li>
			<li>I take classes where I have little to no experience and strive to gain new knowledge and mindset.</li>
		</ol>

		<br>

		<h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>

		<p><strong>Version 1</strong></p>

		<p>I am working on software that will allow competitive gamers to access accurate league standings and ladder rankings
			more efficiently. This will allow individuals more time in game and less time calculating potential stats.</p>

		<p>Unlike similar software, I will involve the community in development in order to accurately present the desired information as fast as possible.
			Although it will take longer to develop, on average less time will be spent waiting on scores and more time improving in game.</p>

		<p>How long do you currently wait for stats to update after completing a game?</p>
