			<h3>Whole Brain</h3>

			<p>Short Answer: <em>I think</em></p>

			<p>My brain works in a circular motion, passing things back and forth from one side of the brain to the other.
				Generally, my left brain dislikes something logical, which sets off an emotion or something that is based
				in feeling on the right side and then returns it to the left. It becomes a war between hemispheres that can
				make for some fun arguments.</p>
		<br>

		<h3>Golden Circle</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Allow for the best use of time.</li>
			<li>Providing a service that brings more desirable data to users faster.</li>
			<li>Create code that will allow competitive gamers to see stats and rankings quickly following the completion
				of a match, allowing for more time spent improving.</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>

		<p><strong>Version 1</strong></p>

		<p>I am working on software that will allow competitive gamers to access accurate league standings and ladder rankings
			more efficiently. This will allow individuals more time in game and less time calculating potential stats.</p>

		<p>Unlike similar software, I will involve the community in development in order to accurately present the desired information as fast as possible.
			Although it will take longer to develop, on average less time will be spent waiting on scores and more time improving in game.</p>

		<p>How long do you currently wait for stats to update after completing a game?</p>

			<p><strong>Version 2</strong></p>
			<p>Hi my name is Tristan. I design software that allows users to more efficiently manage their time. I'm working with a group
				of developers to present more relatable data, faster. How much time do you spend waiting on information?</p>

			<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
			<h3>Week 1</h3>
			<p>Week one was a <strong>blast!</strong>Having the opportunity to learn so much information, while difficult, has proven to be an exciting new step. Learning to develop alongside the other members of Cohort 19 and hearing the success stories from those who came before us is inspiring. I look forward to what week two and the rest of the bootcamp has to offer!</p>
