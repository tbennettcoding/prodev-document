		<h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>

		<p><strong>Version 1</strong></p>

		<p>I am working on software that will allow competitive gamers to access accurate league standings and ladder rankings
			more efficiently. This will allow individuals more time in game and less time calculating potential stats.</p>

		<p>Unlike similar software, I will involve the community in development in order to accurately present the desired information as fast as possible.
			Although it will take longer to develop, on average less time will be spent on waiting and more time improving in game.</p>

		<p>How long do you currently wait for stats to update after completing a game?</p>
